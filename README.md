# Telecom-churn-using-logistic-regression-algorithm
This is a case study where I had to identify whether a telecom customer would churn or not Based on certain parameters for each lead I was able to build a logistic regression model. The model performance was reasonably good as it was able to predict the conversion at an accuracy of 69%, specificity of 67%, sensitivity/recall of 88%
